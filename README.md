# Proxy-fraud-score-checker

The program was coded and tested in Python 3.9 but it should work for older Python3 versions too. It asks the user to input the proxies, grabbing their IP from http://icanhazip.com and sending it to https://scamalytics.com to recieve the fraud score for the proxy.

Please note that the proxies have to be in the username:password@hostname:port format.
After the proxies have been input into the console you need to press the "Enter" key then press "Ctrl + D" to get the program to start working.
